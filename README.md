This is a sample app that show us the power of [Transformations] class extensions [map] and [switchMap] for our LiveData objects. More details on this medium [post].

In this project you'll find:

* Kotlin [coroutines] for background operations.

* Reactive UIs using [LiveData] observables and [Data Binding].
